    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Watching my dad build computers as a kid instilled in me a love of tech and problem solving. 
      He wanted me to pursue Computer Engineering, so of course I got an art degree. 
      At the time, I didn't realize both were creative endeavors. </p>
    <p>Fast forward 10 years, and now Iâ€™m excited to be a developer in a time of increasing accessibility to diverse platforms, 
      where frameworks and languages are becoming more fluid. My interests range from helping people participate in their hobbies more to addressing societal challenges.
      And I still utilize my art degree.
